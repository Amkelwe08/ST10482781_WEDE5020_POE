Overview 
Fnally POE 

I have demonstrated how to apply advanced web development techniques by enhancing the existing Asipiko Creative Agency website with improved interactivity, responsiveness, and SEO compliance.The website follows modern front-end standards using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and showcases the ability to combine functionality with professional design principles. Each page reflects a consistent brand identity while ensuring usability across devices.

The website consists of:
Home Page (index.html): Introduces the agency with a large hero section and an overview of its mission. It highlights key services and integrates navigation links to all pages.
About Page (about.html): Provides an overview of the agency’s history, vision, and commitment to creative excellence.
Services Page (services.html): Displays the main services offered by Asipiko Creative Agency—branding and graphic design, web design and development, and digital marketing—featuring an interactive accordion interface implemented with JavaScript.
Enquiry Page (enquiry.html): Allows potential clients to submit detailed service enquiries using an interactive form validated with JavaScript.
Contact Page (contact.html): Contains contact information, an embedded Google Map of the East London office, and a contact form configured with Formspree for message handling.

The project reflects:
Implementation of responsive web design principles with media queries for desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.
Use of semantic HTML5 structure and clean CSS3 styling aligned with the Asipiko brand colours of blue, gold, and white.
Application of JavaScript interactivity, including accordions, form validation, and a dynamic map embed.
Adherence to SEO best practices, including meta tags, image alt text, internal linking, robots.txt, and sitemap.xml.
A user-friendly interface that maintains visual balance and functionality across all devices.
This project demonstrates my understanding of front-end web technologies and my ability to apply them in a real-world business context, meeting both aesthetic and technical requirements outlined in the module.
